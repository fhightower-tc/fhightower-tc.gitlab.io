# String Rotate

This app takes a string and rotates it the given amount. This method of encoding is often known as a [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) and is sometimes used in Javascript malware to obfuscate the code.

The code for this comes from Floyd Hightower's Biblioteca project (which was inspired by the algorithm here: [https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/this.py](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/this.py)).
