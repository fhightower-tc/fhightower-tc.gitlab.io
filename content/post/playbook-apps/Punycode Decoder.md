There is a playbook using this app to encode a Punycode domain as Unicode [here](/post/playbooks/encode-domain-as-unicode/). If you can't install custom apps on your instance of ThreatConnect, there is a component with this functionality [here](/post/playbook-components/punycode-decoder-and-encoder/).
