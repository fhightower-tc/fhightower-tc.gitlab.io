This library is the foundation for monitoring automated collection systems, allowing analysts to validate their work before sharing, and providing insight into the quality/completeness of data in a ThreatConnect source.

There is a spaces app to create and manage profiles for this system described [here](https://tc.hightower.space/post/spaces-apps/tc-doublecheck-profile-creator-and-manager/).
