If you are able to install custom apps, you should use the array iterator app described here: [https://github.com/ThreatConnect-Inc/threatconnect-playbooks/tree/master/apps/TCPB_-_Array_Iterator](https://github.com/ThreatConnect-Inc/threatconnect-playbooks/tree/master/apps/TCPB_-_Array_Iterator).

If not, there are components to iterate through an array of items described here: [https://pb-constructs.hightower.space/playbooks/constructs/array_iterator](https://pb-constructs.hightower.space/playbooks/constructs/array_iterator). The actual components are available here: [https://gitlab.com/cezhunter/Iterator_Playbook_Components/](https://gitlab.com/cezhunter/Iterator_Playbook_Components/).
